        <p id="main-paragraph">Come visit us at the Cubberly Community Center, located at 4000 Middlefield Road!
              We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more at our
              monthly sale! These are mostly from donations from individuals, estates, and companies. We
              also sell items that the Palo Alto library has removed from their shelves to make room for new
              purchases. Hardbound books start at $1 each and paperback books at $0.50
              cents each. We are also accepting item donations at this time too! </p>

              <p id="paragraph">Our Main Room is along the north driveway, adjacent to the Charleston Shopping Center. Children's books, music, videos, and toys are in our new room (near the Cubberley track,
              Pavilion and the Greendell School) and include picture books, school age fiction and nonfiction, non-English language books, CDs and DVDs,
              and books for parents and teachers. Bargain books are in rooms K6 and K7, where hardbound books are all $1, paperbacks are $0.50
              cents each, and children's books are just $0.25 cents. </p>
          <h3 id="third-article-title">Hours & Information: Saturday - Sunday: 8:00am - 4:30pm Both Days</h3>

          <p id="second-paragraph">Some customers come very early on Saturday to ensure an early place in line. We hand out a
            maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room, beginning at 8 am on the
            Saturday of the sale. If you receive a ticket, the number on it reserves your corresponding place
            in the line, allowing you to go off and get coffee or to visit the Children's and Bargain Book
            rooms. Because of our severe space limitations and compelling issues of health and safety, we will only
            allow 160 customers into the Main Room at a time. Once inside, customers may take only 12 books off of shelves, after which they should purchase these and
            exit via the east door. They may then join at the end of any remaining line at the north door and
            reenter in that order. The limitation of 12 books at a time will continue past noon if a line
            remains outside. All methods of payment are accepted! </p>
