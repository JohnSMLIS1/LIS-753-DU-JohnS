        <p id="main-paragraph">Voil√†! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V.</p>

Elim Garak: [unwilling]  Uh, I don't know...Quark: Come on, aren't you just a little bit curious? [Garak sighs, takes a sip and gags] Quark: What do you think? Elim Garak: It's *vile*! Quark: I know. It's so bubbly, and cloying, and *happy*. Elim Garak: Just like the Federation. Quark: But you know what's really frightening? If you drink enough of it, you begin to *like* it. Elim Garak: It's insidious! Quark: *Just* like the Federation.</p>
