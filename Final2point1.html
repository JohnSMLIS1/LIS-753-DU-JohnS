        <p id="main-paragraph">Sometimes you don't want anything too crazy or are running late in the morning. If you're not running super late, a good kettle can heat up water quickly so you
                              can use the pour over method to make a travel thermos to go. Just heat the water, use a scale to measure 40 grams of coffee for 500 grams of water. Pop in the filter in the pour over device,
                              load the grounds, and pour over, making sure you fully soak the grounds in the filter. Wait for it to drain out and repeat until the scale says 500. Granted, even that can be a lot for someone
                              who needs the first cup of coffee to even function in the morning. Instead, the stoic Mr. Coffee allows you to just load the grounds in the hopper, press a button, and come back in a few minutes.
                              Sometimes you can't beat that level of efficiency, which is most likely the reason that method is still around and one of the most popular.  </p>

              <p id="paragraph">On a weekend of whenever you have time, sometimes a coffee that takes a little more effort, but is equally rewarding might be wanted. This is where something like
                                an espresso or a turkish coffee could come into play. Espresso can be difficult to get right, visit the section below to get a bit mroe insight on how to do it properly to make sure neither
                                time nor money nor grounds are wasted. Turkish coffee can be equally challening, but can be a bit more forgiving. Have the proper grounds (sold pre ground to the correct grind), mix with water,
                                stir and then heat till it froths up a few times. After each froth take it off the heat so it can calm down. Once it calm down, repeat a couple more times until its hot enough to your liking. Pour
                                and serve immediately, with both coffees. Both can be enjoyed black or with a little cream. </p>

          <p id="second-paragraph">Unfortunately, espresso is a bit more commonly available at your local super market when compared to Turkish Coffee (disappointing, we know).
                                   However, espresso may be more readily available, but it can be a challenge to make properly so you aren't wasting any money, and more importantly, aren't wasting any coffee grounds.
                                   This video linked here, is a guide on how to make espresso presented by James Hoffman, the 2007 Barista World Champion. It's easy to follow, fun to watch and fascinating to learn how much goes
                                   into making, a good Cup of Joe. </p>
