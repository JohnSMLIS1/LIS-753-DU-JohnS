        <p id="main-paragraph">While I'm sure we are all familiar with the many types of syrups and sugary flavorings that places like Starbucks or Dunkin adds to their coffee to make it edible,
                              there's a literal entire world out there that has their own distinct coffee crops that all have their own unique flavors. Starbucks and Dunkin have to add all those flavorings so their
                              product doesn't taste like dirt. A good single origin coffee, brewed properly (check out the brewing page on this same site), will allow you to taste all the flavor notes that it claims
                              it has. Add a little cream or sugar if you would like to accentuate the notes, but odds are if made properly, it won't need it or it'll just taste even better. </p>

              <p id="paragraph">Ethiopian coffee is able to claim the first coffee according to legend. Legend has it that the first Arabica plant was discovered there by a goat farmer who
                                noticed that his herd was more awake after they ate the raw coffee cherries. Most people can relate. Ethiopian coffee has flavor is described as, "...distinct and elegant floral, herbal, and citrus notes.
                                The flavour is inimitable, sensitive and delicate; from Ethiopian coffee one can sense notes of jasmine flower, bergamot and blueberry in aftertaste.
                                The body of the coffee is not very strong and acidity is mild and pleasant. In general, Ethiopian coffees are heavy and winey or floral and tea like", according to the Barista Institute website.
                                On the opposite end we have Sumatran coffee. A coffee that has flavor profiles that are more earthy and rich, not as bright and acidic.</p>

          <p id="second-paragraph">Some customers come very early on Saturday to ensure an early place in line. We hand out a
            maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room, beginning at 8 am on the
            Saturday of the sale. If you receive a ticket, the number on it reserves your corresponding place
            in the line, allowing you to go off and get coffee or to visit the Children's and Bargain Book
            rooms. Because of our severe space limitations and compelling issues of health and safety, we will only
            allow 160 customers into the Main Room at a time. Once inside, customers may take only 12 books off of shelves, after which they should purchase these and
            exit via the east door. They may then join at the end of any remaining line at the north door and
            reenter in that order. The limitation of 12 books at a time will continue past noon if a line
            remains outside. All methods of payment are accepted! </p>
